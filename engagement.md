# Engagement Plan

Welcome to Competitions! Engagement for our app is inherent in the usage model, as Competitions hosts CTSA-wide competitions (grant applications and reviews) Otherwise, ways that you can get involved technically include:

- Piloting the platform
- Providing feedback (features, documentation, implementation workflows, etc)
- Contributing to development via open source workflow e.g. GitHub fork and pull request, contributing to documentation
- Submitting feature requests
- Participating in SAML infrastructure to enable SSO (applies to all cloud-based deployments not just Competitions)

On the non-technical side, ways that you can get involved culturally include:

- Developing use cases
- Being a demonstration partner
- Providing feedback on product design
- Utilizing the cloud-deployed instance
- Developing local implementation strategies
- Testing local engagement materials
- Seeking requirements
- Sharing strategies to support local projects
- Collaborating on best practices for local adoption, implementation, engagement, integration
