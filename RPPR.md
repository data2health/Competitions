# Research Design
A platform to support robust peer review within and across CTSA hubs does not currently exist. Competitions is a software tool for investigators, reviewers and administrators to run various types of reviews and competitions, including pilot projects, research awards and reviews. Here, we will upgrade Competitions platform (1) to support CTSA consortium-wide peer-review activities through a cloud-deployment that supports single sign-on and (2) to work on the competitions code base to enhance the ease and robustness of its adoption by interested institutions.

# Methodology

# Expected Outcomes
A functioning prototype of a CTSA Program-level competition review tool for projects and events that can be used in the cloud or implemented locally, if desired. This entails the availability of the following:
- Public GitHub repo where software can be downloaded, features requested, etc.
- A publicly available cloud-hosted instance that supports SSO user authentication, user-created competitions, user-submitted proposals, and user review.
- Engagement/support materials and activities, including documentation for interested adopters.
- Roadmap for next phase of work, including incorporation of expertise work such as CEREC.
