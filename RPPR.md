# Research Design
A platform to support robust peer review within and across CTSA hubs does not currently exist. Competitions is a software tool for investigators, reviewers and administrators to solicit and review various types of competitions; this include pilot projects, research awards and their peer review. Here, we will upgrade Competitions platform (1) to support CTSA consortium-wide peer-review activities through a cloud-deployment that supports single sign-on and (2) to work on the competitions code base to enhance the ease and robustness of its adoption by interested institutions.

# Methodology
The Competitions team is part of the larger ARIG Group at Northwestern University. The team runs a version of the Agile methodology to plan work incrementally, paired with continuous feedback, integration, and testing to drive forward progress of this project. We run bi-weekly sprints, with daily stand-ups where team members can call out blockers and dependencies.

# Expected Outcomes
A functioning prototype of a CTSA Program-level competition review tool for projects and events that can be used in the cloud or implemented locally, if desired. This entails the availability of the following:  

- Public GitHub repo where software can be downloaded, features requested, etc.
- A publicly available cloud-hosted instance that supports SSO user authentication, user-created competitions, user-submitted proposals, and user review.
- Engagement/support materials and activities, including documentation for interested adopters.
- Roadmap for next phase of work, including incorporation of expertise work such as CEREC.

# Timeline (monthly)
Broadly, the goal of this project is to provide a minimally viable cloud-based product by September 30, 2019 for initial presentation to and review by the CTSA community. We envision a 6-month tail after that dedicated to UAT and feedback; hands-on demonstration; on-boarding (including institutional on-boarding to the NCATS SSO platform); and development of multi-modality educational artifacts. *"CD2H Cloud Vanguard"*
