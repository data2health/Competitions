# Competitions

## Vision

A platform to support robust peer review within and across CTSA hubs does not currently exist. Competitions fills this gap with a cloud-based, single-sign on software tool for investigators, reviewers and administrators to operate NIH-style review and scoring. With Competitions, you can post opportunities, submit applications and review and score those submissions.
