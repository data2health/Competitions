To create a grant in Competitions, first apply for Grant Creator access.

You'll receive an email when you've been given access. Go back to Competitions, log in and click on MyGrants > Create Grant

Now you can begin creating your grant!
First, you'll set up the metadata about your grant--you'll give it a name, provide the Request for Applications (RFA) information, and
decide when it should appear on the Competitions website by filling out publish and open/close dates. You have to publish your grant
AND the Publish Date needs to have been reached in order for your grant to show up on Competitions.

Continue creating the metadata about your grant by filling out how many reviewers should assess a submission. Also provide the limit
of submissions a reviewer has to assess (to avoid reviewer fatigue).

Save the metadata about your grant. Now, onto the actual questions! Use the Submission Questions form for asking questions of the 
people applying for your grant. You can group these questions into sections, if you'd like. You can also specify if they need to 
upload any documents.
