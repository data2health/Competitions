## Competitions Education Plan

We will focus our educational activities for the Competitions project toward support for the user community, which will consist of material development and both synchronus and asynchronus trainings. Below is a list of activities we have planned to create educational opportunities.

* Create a "quick-start" guide for participating in a competition, serving as a reviewer, and for setting up a new competition, along with some key use cases
* Create a guide on implementing Competitions to run as a local installation 
* Build a set of templates that can be used for common workflows (e.g., generic pilot grants, scholar program, vouchers, and mock study sections)
* YouTube videos of key Competitions workflows.
* Virtual office hours/demos
