# Competitions
Competitions is an open source tool to run NIH-style peer review of competitions, pilot projects, and research proposals in a cloud-based consortium-wide single sign-on platform.

## Problem statement
A platform to support robust peer review within and across CTSA hubs does not currently exist. Competitions is a software tool for investigators, reviewers and administrators to run various types of reviews and competitions, including pilot projects, research awards and reviews. 

## Project description
Here, we will upgrade Competitions platform (1) to support CTSA consortium-wide peer-review activities through a cloud-deployment that supports single sign-on and (2) enhance the competitions code base to improve the ease and robustness of local adoption by interested institutions.


## Alignment to program objectives
See the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) [here](https://github.com/data2health/roadmap/blob/master/cd2h-foa.md).

## Repositories

- CD2H Phase II project repo: https://github.com/data2health/competitions-project
- Code repo: https://github.com/NUARIG/competitions

## Deliverables
A functioning prototype of a CTSA Program-level competition review tool for projects and events that can be used in the cloud or implemented locally, if desired


## Milestones 
- Set up authentication
- Set up cloud or local hosting environment
- Code Competitions for cloud
- User acceptance testing
- Evaluation work stream

## Evaluation
- Usage metrics of the cloud instance: unique user counts, unique user log-ins, active competitions created, number of submissions, reviews, etc.
- Local adoption (attempted, successful)
- Measure of open-source contribution: Pull requests, GitHub issues (opened, resolution, and unique contributors)
